# ImageUpload
Currently the project accepts any file that the user uploads, but will be tweaked in the near future to only accept images. The end goal is to create a flickr clone.

# Directories
**public:** where the stylesheet(s) and javascript(s) live (public/js, public/stylesheets) <br/>
**uploads:** where the files are stored once the user uploads
